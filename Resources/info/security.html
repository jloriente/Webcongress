        <b>LIFE FESTIVAL</b> is a limited Event. Getting this special License will allow us to enjoy more hours of music during the night and have a relaxed festival.

    </p>
    <p>
        Gatecrashers can put the Festival life at Risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gardai is aware of this and this has forced us to implement a security plan to provide a safe Event to our LIFERS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learn the lesson form previous years. Security levels will be much more efficient particularly outside the event and on the perimeter to provide, as reassurance, a presence in the local area and to deal with potential crime. In the arena, our security will be friendly, but firm. Use of CCTV and a new In/out system with checking wristbands points in camping entry / exit and arenas will be implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some of the new security improvements are Compacting Festival area Creating a full vision perimeter visibility High Level Security Wristbands.
    </p>
    <p>
        Strategic Security Positions and Wristbands control checking points.
        This year the Camping will be fenced and secured. with vigilant towers and the entrance/ exits to the Camping will be Wristband checked.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working on your security to have a safe Life.
